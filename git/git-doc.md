# Git Practice
> In this we are doing some basic but useful git commands used in day to day life :)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### BRANCH
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Create branch**
go to that branch from where we need to create new branch and use below command:

- creating branch locally

```sh
$ git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
```
this will create new branch at local
now the second step to move this local branch to remote repository

- pushing local branch to remote:


```sh
$ git push --set-upstream origin <new-branch-name>
$ git push --set-upstream origin release/0.0.1
```

**Listing of branch**
```sh
$ git branch -a
```

**Rename Branch**

- checkout the branch which we want to rename and execute below command

```
$ git branch -m <new-branch-name>
```
- Rename branch from any loaction and execute below command

```
$ git branch -m <old-branch-name> <new-branch-name>
```

**Delete Branch**
- Delete a branch on your local filesystem :
```sh
$ git branch -d [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

- To force the deletion of local branch on your filesystem :
```sh
$ git branch -D [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

- Delete the branch on github :
```sh
$ git push origin :[name_of_your_new_branch]
```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### TAG
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Creating new tag**

```
$ git tag <tag-name>
```

- This is a annotated tag, It adds additional metadata  

```
$ git tag -a <tag-name>
```
- This is a annotated tag, It adds additional metadata and commit message  

```
$ git tag -a <tag-name> -m 'message'
```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### REBASE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Reword**

- Use the below command to display a list of the last n commits.

```
$ git rebase -i HEAD~n 
```

```sh
$ git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

```sh
pick 491e303 practice | add method added
pick 12bb02d git-command | added git branch related command
pick e621241 git-command | delete branch command added

# Rebase ee4686c..e621241 onto ee4686c (3 commands)
#
# Commands:
# p, pick <commit> = use commit
# r, reword <commit> = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit <commit> = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash <commit> = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup <commit> = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec <command> = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# d, drop <commit> = remove commit
# l, label <label> = label current HEAD with a name
# t, reset <label> = reset HEAD to a label
# m, merge [-C <commit> | -c <commit>] <label> [# <oneline>]
# .       create a merge commit using the original merge commit's
# .       message (or the oneline, if no original merge commit was
# .       specified). Use -c <commit> to reword the commit message.
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
#	However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
#	
# Note that empty commits are commented out
```
- replace the pick with reword which wants update 
```sh
pick 491e303 practice | add method added
reword 12bb02d git-command | added git branch related command
pick e621241 git-command | delete branch command added
```

- save & close the file
- update the commit message in resulting file from above action.

- force push the commits.
```sh
$ git push --force
```

**Squash**

```sh
$ git rebase -i HEAD~5
```

```sh
pick 4a3f7f4 git-command | delete branch command added
pick e566bfe git-command | reword using git rebase command added in readme file
pick c00f38f git-command | updated readme file format
pick affb1e7 git-command | updated readme file format
pick c4a1c4b git-command | updated readme file format

# Rebase 4d58e45..c4a1c4b onto 4d58e45 (5 commands)
#
# Commands:
# p, pick <commit> = use commit
# r, reword <commit> = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit <commit> = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash <commit> = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup <commit> = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec <command> = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# d, drop <commit> = remove commit
# l, label <label> = label current HEAD with a name
# t, reset <label> = reset HEAD to a label
# m, merge [-C <commit> | -c <commit>] <label> [# <oneline>]
# .       create a merge commit using the original merge commit's
# .       message (or the oneline, if no original merge commit was
# .       specified). Use -c <commit> to reword the commit message.
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
#	However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
#	
# Note that empty commits are commented out

```

- replace pick with squash where we want to do
```sh
pick 4a3f7f4 git-command | delete branch command added
pick e566bfe git-command | reword using git rebase command added in readme file
squash c00f38f git-command | updated readme file format
squash affb1e7 git-command | updated readme file format
squash c4a1c4b git-command | updated readme file format
```
- here we are doing for 3 commits .

- then force push changes

```sh
$ git push --force
```

**Drop commit remote**
```sh 
$ git rebase -i HEAD~2
```

it will open file git-rebase-todo
```sh
pick 5ef0cdc git-command | readme file formated
pick bdac559 git-command | drop commit temp dada added

# Rebase b4411c4..bdac559 onto b4411c4 (2 commands)
#
# Commands:
# d, drop <commit> = remove commit
.
.
```
- drop the commit we want it
```sh
pick 5ef0cdc git-command | readme file formated
drop bdac559 git-command | drop commit temp dada added
```
- we can drop multiple commits as we want
- then force push changes
```sh
$ git push --force
```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### RESET
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**To reset our head to previous commit**

```sh 
$ git reset â€” hard 
```

**To reset single file to previous commit**

```sh 
$ git reset <filename>
```

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### COMMIT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Commit commands **

>Ref- https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history

- To change most recent commit message

```sh
$ git commit --amend
```
- this command opens file COMMIT_EDITMSG . then in this file we can update our most recent message and save the file.
```sh
git-command | drop command added

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# Date:      Sat Mar 21 15:31:16 2020 +0000
#
# On branch feature/git-command
# Your branch and 'origin/feature/git-command' have diverged,
# and have 1 and 1 different commits each, respectively.
#   (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)
#
# Changes to be committed:
#	modified:   README.md
#

```
- To give previous commit message to current commit locally

```sh 
$ git commit --amend --no-edit
```
